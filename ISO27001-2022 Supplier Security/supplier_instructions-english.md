# Supplier Self-Assessment Instructions (English)

Thank you for completing our ISO 27001:2022 supplier cybersecurity self-assessment. The HTML questionnaire runs entirely offline in your browser and allows you to save progress at any time. Follow the steps below to provide an accurate picture of your security posture.

## 1. Before You Begin
- Use a current desktop browser (Chrome or Edge recommended; Firefox and Safari are supported).
- Download the file `supplier-cybersecurity-assessment.html` to your computer.
- Ensure your browser allows file downloads and JavaScript. Pop-up blockers may need to permit the download triggered by the form.

## 2. Open the Assessment
- Locate the HTML file on your computer and double-click to open it.
- The assessment runs locally; no internet connection is required and no data is transmitted to our systems until you send back the saved file.
- Check that the assessment date at the top reflects today. This date is stored with your responses and is part of the returned file name.

## 3. Complete Company Information
- Fill in all required fields in the “Supplier Information” section:
  - Company name
  - Primary contact person
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Assessment date (pre-filled with today’s date; adjust if needed)
- These fields must be completed before you can save the assessment.

## 4. Answer the 39 Security Questions
- The questionnaire covers 10 control domains aligned with ISO 27001:2022.
- For each question, choose the maturity level that best matches your current implementation:
-  Options describe increasing degrees of control maturity: from `Not Implemented` through `Fully Mature`, plus `Not Applicable` when a control is irrelevant.
- Answer honestly; add clarifying details in the “Additional Comments” box if helpful.
- You can leave questions blank and return later. The progress bar and maturity score update automatically as you select answers.

## 5. Save Your Responses
- When ready, scroll to the bottom and select **“Save Assessment to Disk.”**
- Your browser downloads a new HTML file named `security_assessment-<yourcompany>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.html`.
- The saved file includes every answer you have provided so far. You may save multiple times; each save refreshes the embedded data and updates the date in the filename.

## 6. Resume Later (Optional)
- To continue later, open the most recently saved `security_assessment-...html` file.
- All previously entered information, the score, and progress indicators will appear exactly as you saved them.
- Update responses as needed and click **“Save Assessment to Disk”** again when finished.

## 7. Submit the Completed Assessment
- Email the latest saved HTML file back to your designated contact by the requested deadline.
- Do not send screenshots or PDF exports; we require the HTML file so the data remains machine-readable.
- If you maintain evidence or remediation plans, you may attach them separately or note where they can be accessed.

## 8. Need Assistance?
- For clarifications on the questionnaire or our security expectations, contact the requestor listed in the covering email.
- For technical issues (e.g., file will not download), try another supported browser or temporarily allow pop-ups/downloads for local files.
- If you discover incorrect information after submission, update the assessment, save again, and resend. Clearly mark the email subject as an updated submission.

Thank you for your cooperation. Your responses help us assess and strengthen the security of our shared ecosystem.
