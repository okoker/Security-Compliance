# Supplier Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Instructions

## 📋 Purpose of This Assessment

This self-assessment form has been designed to evaluate your organization's information security maturity level as part of our supply chain risk management program. 

The assessment is based on **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** - the international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). By completing this assessment, you help us:

- **Understand your security posture** and identify potential risks in our supply chain
- **Ensure compliance** with information security requirements
- **Build trust** through transparency about security practices
- **Identify areas for collaboration** and mutual improvement

This is not an audit or certification process. It's a practical evaluation tool to understand how you manage information security risks.

## 🎯 Understanding Maturity Levels

Choose the option that most accurately reflects your organization's current practices:

| Maturity Level | Description | When to Select |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Not Implemented** | No formal process or control exists | You don't have this control in place at all |
| **Partially Implemented** | Process exists but is informal, inconsistent, or incomplete | You do this sometimes or informally, but it's not documented or consistent |
| **Implemented** | Process is documented and consistently followed | You have documented procedures that are regularly followed |
| **Fully Mature** | Process is optimized, regularly reviewed, and continuously improved | You not only follow the process but regularly measure, review, and improve it |
| **Not Applicable** | Control is not relevant to your organization | This doesn't apply to your business model or operations |

**Important Tips:**
- ✅ Be honest - this helps both organizations
- ✅ If unsure between two levels, choose the lower one
- ✅ "Not Applicable" is a valid answer for some controls
- ✅ You can save partially completed forms and continue later
