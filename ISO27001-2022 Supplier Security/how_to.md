# Managing the ISO 27001:2022 Supplier Assessment

This guide is for the team member who owns the supplier security assessment program. It explains how to prepare, distribute, collect, and archive the self‑assessment (`supplier-cybersecurity-assessment.html`) when working with existing or prospective suppliers.

## 1. Prepare the Assessment Package
- Review the latest HTML questionnaire to confirm it reflects your current control expectations.
- Decide which language versions of the supplier instructions you will share (English, Turkish, Italian, or Spanish). Each supplier only needs the instructions that fit their language preference.
- Draft the covering email you will send to suppliers. Include submission deadlines, your contact details, and where to send questions.

## 2. Configure Internal Tracking
- Create a tracker (spreadsheet or ticket) listing each supplier, their primary contact, send date, due date, and status.
- Define a review workflow: who will analyse responses, how findings are documented, and escalation paths when gaps are discovered.
- Identify where completed assessments will be stored (e.g., shared drive or GRC tool) and ensure access is restricted to the security/compliance team.

## 3. Distribute to Suppliers
- Attach the HTML file (`supplier-cybersecurity-assessment.html`) and the appropriate `supplier_instructions-<language>.md` file.
- Highlight that the form is fully offline and should be opened in a current desktop browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- Remind suppliers that they must click **“Save Assessment to Disk”** and email back the downloaded file (the filename includes their company name and save date).
- Include the deadline and request acknowledgement of receipt.

## 4. Support Suppliers During Completion
- Be available to clarify any control requirements, maturity scoring, or evidence expectations.
- If suppliers encounter technical issues (e.g., blocked downloads, JavaScript errors), advise them to try another browser or disable pop-up blockers temporarily.
- When partial submissions are needed, remind them they can reopen the saved HTML, continue answering, and save again; the most recent save updates the embedded answers and the filename date.

## 5. Receive and Review Submissions
- Confirm the returned file name follows the pattern `security_assessment-<supplier>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.html` and that the embedded date matches the save date.
- Open the HTML and verify all required company information fields are populated.
- Export or note the total score, maturity level, and any comments. Compare results against your minimum security requirements or risk appetite.
- Document follow-up actions for controls scored “Not Implemented” or “Partially Implemented,” and track remediation commitments.

## 6. Store and Retain Records
- Save the completed HTML in the controlled repository you designated in step 2.
- Apply version control or naming conventions if multiple submissions are expected (e.g., quarterly updates).
- Restrict read access to personnel supporting vendor risk management and audit functions.

## 7. Feed Results Into Your Governance Process
- Update your supplier risk register with the assessment outcome, agreed remediation items, and next review date.
- Escalate high-risk findings to management, legal, or procurement as required.
- Use aggregated results to inform broader security improvement initiatives and compliance reporting.

## 8. Maintain the Assessment Artefacts
- Periodically review the questionnaire content and instructions to ensure alignment with policy updates or regulatory changes.
- Retain old versions for audit reference, but only distribute the current release.
- Notify suppliers proactively if a new version supersedes the one they completed and guide them through re-assessment if necessary.
